The open ticket has now been assigned, and its priority status has been escalated from "Normal" to "Emergency." Additionally, the ticket was transferred to the System Administrators Department, which was previously housed under the Support Department. The SLA was also changed from "Default" to "Sev-A" to align better with the severity of the issue.

The ticket issue was successfully resolved through collaboration with the system administration team. A systems engineer identified the problem, which was related to a load balancer, and subsequently resolved the ticket.
